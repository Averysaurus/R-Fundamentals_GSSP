# R-Fundamentals - Script 4 of 4

##### R-Markdown (homework) 

##### Challenge going further with R Markdown, bookdown, and dashboards
##### Recall that we have been going through R script files - these are just plain text files but with a .R extension. These are plain text files where we must enter a hashtag before text to enter it correctly, while entering code normally. However, R Markdown files are fully reproducible documents (with a .Rmd file extension) that mix text (entered normally and without the need for hashtags) and "chunks" of code (you can still hashtag comments inside a chunk of cocde). Open an R Markdown file by clicking File --> New File --> R Markdown... Give it a title, make sure the HTML button is selected, and click OK. 

##### 1. Go through the RStudio tutorial to learn how to "knit" R Markdown files into HTML and other vibrant formats: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/
##### 2. Furthermore, you can turn your R Markdown files into dynamic e-books! Go through yihui's excellent bookdown tutorial: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html
##### 3. Additionally, you can create fast dashboards by following this guide: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/
