# Day 4

# Part 1 - mtcars

# 1. Load the mtcars dataset.

# 2. What are some useful functions to learn more about the data?

# 3. Might you surmise a relationship about something like engine size and miles per gallon?

# 4. Create boxplots for mpg as parsed by cyl.

# 5. What does cor.test reveal about mpg and cyl?

# 6. Create a scatterplot of the “mpg” and “hp” variables using ggplot(). What do you notice?

# 7. Can cyl be used to predict mpg in a linear regression model? Why must you learn about the assumptions of a statistical test before applying it (or any other statistical test)?



# Part 2 - gapminder

# 1. Now that you are warmed up, load the “gapminder-FiveYearData.csv” file for yet another dataset you have never seen before. Save it in a variable named gap:

# 2. How would you learn more about this dataset?

# 3. Accomplish the following tasks:

# 3A) Write three sentences describing this dataset and write one sentence that proposes a research question to be investigated.

# 3B) Turn your research question into a testable hypothesis:

# 3C) Compute descriptive statistics for each variable in the dataset.

# 3D) Can you visualize the data from every single column in this dataset? Create a histogram, boxplot, or scatterplot for the ones you can, and explain in writing the ones you cannot.

# 3E) Do these plots inform you about anything specific that fits your hypothesis and that you can justifiably test?

# 3F) Interpret your plots and your statistical tests - what is going on?
