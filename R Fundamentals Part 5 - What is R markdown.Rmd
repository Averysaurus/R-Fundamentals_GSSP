# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

# Why use R Markdown?

R Markdown allows you create documents of various kinds. Check out the [R Markdown Quick Tour](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html). Some highlights:  

1. Enter text as normal. No special formatting is required for regular text.  

2. Code should be entered inside "chunks" that look like this:  

```{r}
2 + 2 # hashtag text within a chunk to comment it.

# click "Code" and "Insert chunk" to see the keyboard shortcut.  

data(iris); summary(iris)
```

3. Run a line of code like normal - remember you can select multiple lines to run at once.  

4. Click the green "Play" button on the right side of a chunk to run the entire chunk.  

5. Click the "Run" button (top right portion of your R Markdown window) to see various run options.  

6. Click "Tools" --> "Global options" --> "Code" and make sure the box is checked that says "soft wrap R source files".  

7. Click "Tools" --> "Global options" --> "Appearance" to change your color and font settings.  

8. Click "Tools" --> "Global options" --> "R Markdown" and make sure to uncheck the box "Show output inline for all R Markdown documents" _and_ check the box that says "Show document outline by default". Also click "Code" --> "Show document outline" to include a clickable table of contents in your RStudio session.  

9. Use "knitr" to generate [.HTML](https://html.com/), .docx, .pdf files, slideshows, and fancy applications. Click [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) for walkthroughs and examples.  

10. You can also embed plots, for example: 

```{r}
heart = read.csv("./data/heart.csv")

# For sex column, recode 0 = Female, 1 = Male
heart$sex_fac = ifelse(heart$sex == 0, "Female", "Male")

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = heart, aes(x = age, y = chol, col = sex_fac)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.5) + 
  ggtitle("Cholestorol versus age") + 
  xlab("Age (years)") + 
  ylab("Serum cholestorol (mg/dl)") +
  labs(col = "Sex") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "blue")) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
  
```

11. Include statistical tests as well: 

```{r}
cor.test(heart$age, heart$chol)
```
