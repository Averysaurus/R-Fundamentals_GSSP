## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

### So what does it help you do? 
It allows you create documents of various kinds. Check out the [R Markdown Quick Tour](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html). Some highlights:
1. Enter text as normal. No special formatting is required for regular text.   
2. Code should be entered inside "chunks" that look like this:  
```{r}
2 + 2
# hashtag text within a chunk to comment it.

# click "Code" and "Insert chunk" to see the keyboard shortcut.  
```
3. Run a line of code like normal - remember you can select multiple lines to run at once.  
4. Click the green "Play" button on the right side of a chunk to run the entire chunk.  
5. Click the "Run" button (top right portion of your R Markdown window) to see various run options.  
6. Click "Tools" --> "Global options" --> "Code" and make sure the box is checked that says "soft wrap R source files".  
7. Click "Tools" --> "Global options" --> "Appearance" to change your color and font settings.  
8. Click "Tools" --> "Global options" --> "R Markdown" and make sure to uncheck the box "Show output inline for all R Markdown documents" _and_ check the box that says "Show document outline by default". (otherwise, click "Code" --> "Show document outline").  
9. Use "knitr" to generate [.HTML](https://html.com/), .docx, .pdf files, slideshows, and fancy applications. Click [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) for walkthroughs and examples.  

Make sure you have correctly installed and libraried the "rmarkdown" and "knitr" packages. _**Visit**_ [D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) to learn more! 

```{r}
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, 
                        color = Species, shsape = Species)) + 
  geom_point(size = 7.8, alpha = 0.25) + 
  theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = "top")
```
