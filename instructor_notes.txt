This condensed version of the Dlab's R-fundamentals is designed for teaching in two 1.5 hour sessions. 

Challenges have been removed, but there are a few places where students will be encouraged to interact by adding their own code to the material. 
The GSSP class hosts an interdisciplinary student body: some students may have experience in data analysis and coding, others not so much, or not at all. 
Some key points are highlighted here in efforts to promote inclusion and removal learning barriers with all students of these condensed push-in sessions.

Before the first session: 

* Communicate with the GSI and forward this repository link to them. 
* Ask GSI to share repo link with students, but emphasize students accessing the materials through github alone (downloading the repo folder via the green download button). 
* Some students may have zero experience with github, and access to materials via anywhere else (bCourses, email, etc) can confuse when the code along begins. 
* Instructions for github access are in this repo's readme file. 
* Draw attention to downloading R and R-studio (directions, links in the readme as well). 
* Ask that students have both downloaded at time of first session, or that instructions are disseminated to students aporiori. 


At the first session: 

* This may be the first class meeting, expect confusion. Expect that a few students may need to download R and R-studio on the spot. 
* Emphasize the difference between R and R-studio. Students may click open R and try to interact there instead of the R-studio IDE. Be sure to differentiate the two. 
* Understand it's a squeezy situation: most students will feel bombarded with the pace of Part1.R at double time. 
* Refer to the repo as a resource, study materials to return to at their own pace.  
* Part1.R is a little much to complete in the 1.5 hours. Leave the rest as homework if your not there by the end. 
* The big takeaway in this session is just exposure to R coding, that and having R and Rstudio operational on their laptop. 
* Be prepared to stay after class and connect with students one-on-one for a quick consult if they reach out. 


Between the first and second session: 

* Follow up with GSI about Rstudio cloud, alternatives. 
* Ask GSI to plug the Dlab consulting services as a go to in case someone cannot access R-studio at all.
* Ask that the GSI partner with students to support accessibility solutions with Rstudio during the week. 


At the second session: 

* Begin with Part2.R 
* Take time to revist the Rstudio IDE, which of the 4 windows are what and why.. 
* Brace yourself for working directory problems, lol. No class is immune to working directory confusion!! It's okay to take time as a class on this, slow up the tempo, pause your lecture. Breakout into helping students 1-on-1 as needed. 
* If you're pushed against the clock, hurry through subsetting and focus on visualizations with the time left. 
* Part4.R is just a little primer in markdown and YAML, okay to leave it as homework.
